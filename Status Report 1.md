# Status Report 1

(1) what was accomplished during the week

- Synced data sources progress during the break. Some good news among bad news
  - Opted to web scraping for data that was not available
- Exploring alternatives after talking to the founder of Open Syllabus
  - Data Mining Common Crawl - Should be fun
- Generated some dummy data for front-end development
